vii. Summarizing Scores

The code below will help us to summarize the overall positive, negative, and 
neutral scores:

> datafrm = ddply(sent.scores, c("Shopping_Site"), 
summarise,
pos_count=sum( positive ),
neg_count=sum( negative ),
neu_count=sum(neutral))

To put it in another way, we will create the total count by adding the positive, 
negative, and neutral sums.

> datafrm$total_count = datafrm$pos_count +datafrm$neg_count + datafrm$neu_count

Additionally, we will calculate the positive, negative, and neutral percentages 
using the code below:

> datafrm$pos_percent_score = round( 100*datafrm$pos_count/datafrm$total_count )

> datafrm$neg_percent_score = round( 100*datafrm$neg_count/datafrm$total_count )

> datafrm$neu_percent_score = round( 100*datafrm$neu_count/datafrm$total_count )

viii. Comparison Charts

Comparison 1 - Positive Comparative Analysis
Here is the code to create a positive comparison pie chart for these three ecommerce companies:

> attach(datafrm)

> pie.chart.lbls <-paste(datafrm$Shopping_Site,datafrm$pos_percent_score)

> pie.chart.lbls <- paste(pie.chart.lbls,"percent",sep="")

> pie(pos_percent_score, labels = pie.chart.lbls, col = rainbow(length(pie.chart.lbls)), 
main = "Positive Comparative Analysis - Shopping Site")

** Take the Plot snap as it is and paste just below the above code and write the following explaination.

The pie chart below represents the positive percentage score of these companies:

Comparison 2 - Negative Comparative Analysis

Here is the code to create a negative comparison pie chart for these three ecommerce companies:
pie.chart.lbls <-paste(datafrm$Shopping_Site,datafrm$neg_percent_score)

pie.chart.lbls <- paste(pie.chart.lbls,"percent",sep="")

pie(neg_percent_score, labels = pie.chart.lbls, col = 
rainbow(length(pie.chart.lbls)), main = " Negative 
Comparative Analysis - Shopping Site")

** Take the Plot snap as it is and paste just below the above code and write the following explaination.

The pie chart below represents the negative percentage score of these three 
companies: 

Comparison 3 - Neutral Comparative Analysis

Here is the code to create a neutral comparison pie chart:

pie.chart.lbls <-paste(datafrm$Shopping_Site,datafrm$neu_percent_score)

pie.chart.lbls <- paste(pie.chart.lbls,"percent",sep="")

pie(neu_percent_score, labels = pie.chart.lbls, col = 
rainbow(length(pie.chart.lbls)), main = "Neutral Comparative 
Analysis - Shopping Site")

** Take the Plot snap as it is and paste just below the above code and write the following explaination.

The pie chart below represents the neutral percentage score of these three 
companies:
