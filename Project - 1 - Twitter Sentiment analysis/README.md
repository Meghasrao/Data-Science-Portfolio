### INTRODUCTION
# PROJECT BACKGROUND
Social media, as a platform for socializing and communicating, has evolved greatly over the past decade. It now serves 
as medium for people to express their views, displeasures and appreciation to people and companies about their 
services and products. Because of this openness and ease to share feedback, companies target social media to 
understand their customers better. This project will help us understand how consumer sentiment extracted from the 
tweets through machine learning can be used to generate insights regarding product acceptability and performance in 
the market.

# WHAT IS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS?
Sentiment analysis is the most common text classification tool that analyses an incoming message and tells whether 
the underlying sentiment is positive, negative or neutral.
Sentiment analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. A sentiment 
analysis system for text analysis combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to 
assign weighted sentiment scores to the entities, topics, themes and categories within a sentence or phrase.
WHY DO WE NEED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS?
Sentiment analysis systems allows companies to derive information from unstructured texts by automating business 
processes, getting actionable insights and saving hours of manual data processing, in other words, by making teams 
more efficient.
Some of the advantages of sentiment analysis includes the following:
• Scalability:
There’s just too much data to process manually like, thousands of tweets, customer support conversations, or customer 
reviews. Sentiment analysis allows to process data at a faster rate in an efficient and cost-effective way.
• Real-time analysis:
We can use sentiment analysis to identify critical information that allows situational awareness during specific 
scenarios in real-time. Like, is there a PR crisis in social media about to burst? An angry customer that is about to 
churn? A sentiment analysis system can help you immediately identify these kinds of situations and take action.
• Consistent criteria:
Text analysis is a subjective task which is heavily influenced by personal experiences, thoughts, and beliefs. By using 
a centralized sentiment analysis system, companies can apply the same criteria to all of their data. This helps to reduce 
errors and improve data consistency.

# TWITTER ANALYTICS WITH R
Text analysis in particular has become well established in R. There is a vast collection of dedicated text processing 
and text analysis packages, from low-level string operations to advanced text modeling techniques such as fitting 
Latent Dirichlet Allocation models, R provides it all. One of the main advantages of performing text analysis in R is 
that it is often possible, and relatively easy, to switch between different packages or to combine them. Recent efforts 
among the R text analysis developers’ community are designed to promote this interoperability to maximize flexibility 
and choice among users.4 As a result, learning the basics for text analysis in R provides access to a wide range of 
advanced text analysis features.
Twitter is an online microblogging tool that disseminates more than 400 million messages per day, including vast 
amounts of information about almost all industries from entertainment to sports, health to business etc. One of the best 
things about Twitter — indeed, perhaps its greatest appeal — is in its accessibility. It’s easy to use both for sharing 
information and for collecting it.
